When I was deciding what undergraduate degree should I pursue almost a decade ago, I was selecting by the process of elimination. I eliminated all biology or medical related courses simply because I did not want to study them anymore. I knew that I wanted something that is mathematically rigorous. Well, life has its own ways and look where did I land my first official data science job - in a hospital! Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to be exact - the largest and oldest hospital in Singapore. 

Back when I was searching for a new role, I was looking for a data science role either in the e-commerce or healthcare industry and not in more lucrative industries like finance. Although I do have my own personal financial goals and going into the finance industry would probably make more sense, I'd like to find more meaning in my work so that life becomes more bearable haha. In both e-commerce and healthcare, I do feel that I would be able to make an impact in other people's lives - be it directly or indirectly - and also there are abundant of data that I could play with.

In my job search, I did not manage to land any role in e-commerce unfortunately but SGH had an opening which I applied and received an offer. I did not know what I was getting into when I first accepted the job offer but what I knew back then was - I had to eventually secure another job as my contract role as project officer in Nanyang Technological University was coming to an end. Although I managed to extend my role, it was not a sustainable career as I had to decide whether to pursue a PhD, something that I was very hesitant to do. 

Now, it has been about six months since I have joined SGH and I have to say, it is a blessing in disguise. So far, I find that my work is rather fulfilling and I am enjoying my work so far - learning new things and meeting new people.

I do not regret accepting the offer because now the data is more alive than ever. Each data point is not just a data point that was collected from an unknown person in a point in time. Rather, each data point tells a story of a particular patient, a particular person and working in a hospital allows me to see that set of data plays out in real life and able to see the consequence of the collected data. This is one aspect of working as a data scientist in a hospital that no one would tell you.

I still remember what my boss said during the interview: _"We are data rich but not information rich"_. A phrase that seems so simple yet so powerful. There is just so much data could do and they are waiting to be discovered.

Though working in a hospital and dealing with patient's care does come with its own challenges. One major challenge is the high emphasis on data governance. Data governance talks about how data may be accessed and used as well as how the patient's privacy is protected. I do know that there would be some form of data privacy concern in whatever industry but I did not know about the importance and emphasis on data access and usage. Because of the multiple levels of loops before I am allowed to have a look at the data, the data science project move much slower than expected. Then again, it could be because I myself work much faster than others since my previous job has taught me to manage my own time.
