I initially planned to write a follow-up to my goals declaration [post](./2025-goals) and talk about how my goals had shifted over time. Halfway through, I scrapped that idea and decided to write a simple reflection on the year instead.

<hr>

Out of the five goals I shared, I did not fully achieve any of them. Some goals also changed along the way. One example was switching from planning for the MLS-C01 certification to SAP-C02. This was not indecision. It came from spending time thinking about where I want to head next.

Over the year, I became more certain that I want to focus on software and backend engineering.

Machine learning and AI are interesting, and I do enjoy learning and using them in my day to day work. But when I ask myself whether I want to do this repeatedly for the next 10 to 20 years, the answer is probably no. The space moves extremely fast, and I do not want to spend most of my time constantly catching up.

I also enjoy software and backend engineering more. The work feels concrete, and what I build usually gets shipped and used. I am much more drawn to applied work than research. While paths like MLOps or AIOps are options, the space feels crowded and overhyped right now, and many companies are not ready to support it well.

Another pattern I noticed is that I tend to take on more than I can handle.

Beyond the five goals I shared publicly, I had work goals, study goals, and a long list of miscellaneous ones. Each of them demanded time, effort, and focus. In the end, something always had to give.

What I learned is the importance of pacing and capacity planning. Instead of stacking goals endlessly, I need to be realistic about what I can actually finish. In a way, this is about being my own project manager.

I also learned that not all goals are equal. Some are nice to have but do not really matter to me or have much impact. They mainly exist for a sense of completion rather than real value.

Going forward, my approach is simple. List everything, pick the top three goals for the year, and focus on those. From there, break them down into clear milestones and stick to them.

Despite missing some targets, this year still came with a lot of growth, both personally and professionally.

On a personal level, I understand myself better. I prefer quieter environments and less crowded places. I enjoy being mentally challenged. I also know what kinds of shows and activities I genuinely enjoy, and which ones I do not. More importantly, I have a clearer sense of what I want and what I want to avoid in life.

Professionally, high workload and repeated tasks forced me to reflect on my own code. I started asking where logic could be reused, where functions could be generalized, and where pipelines could be simplified instead of duplicated. It was not easy, but it pushed me to think more like an engineer building systems rather than just features.

I also finally tackled something I had put off for a long time, data structures and algorithms. I used to think they were not that useful since most of my time is spent building real features. Looking back, that was a mistake. Going through them helped me spot weaknesses in my code and see where even simple features could be written much better.

Overall, it was a good year. I became a better engineer and a more self aware person. Most importantly, I now have a clearer idea of what I want for the next five to ten years.

Next year is about having a proper plan and executing it well.
