I have not been actively looking for a new role this year since I still enjoy my work at my current company. That said, it makes sense to stay aware of what the market expects and use interviews as a way to spot gaps in my skills.

I recently had the chance to interview with a financial institution. The interview had two parts, system design and data structures and algorithms.

I felt comfortable with the system design round, mainly because I design and review workflows regularly in my current role.

The DSA round was a different story. This has always been a weak spot for me, and I am working on it. I have gone through MIT OCW 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms to build the concepts, but I have not spent enough time coding the solutions yet. I know I need time to properly absorb and apply what I learned.

During the interview, I could explain the general approach to the problems, but I struggled to write the code confidently. While my answers were likely correct at a conceptual level, not being able to code them clearly was a major drawback.

Still, the experience was useful. It confirmed that I understand the ideas, but also showed that understanding alone is not enough in interviews. I need more hands-on practice.

As much as I find LeetCode interviews detached from real work, this is the system in place. So the next step is simple, spend more time practicing problems and writing code until it becomes natural.
