I've been using my [GitHub Pages site](./new-github-page-launch) to blog for a while now, but I've always felt slightly uncomfortable with it. The main issue? **Privacy**.

GitHub Pages requires the repository to be public, which means anyone can not only view the site, but also clone the entire repo and see every single commit I've ever pushed - including mistakes I may have made, or sensitive content I accidentally committed. That felt like a huge security risk to me.

That discomfort motivated me to build my own web app. I wasn't sure what the best stack would be, but colleagues recommended React, saying it's widely used and fairly beginner-friendly. The problem was - I'm not a JavaScript person. Sure, I had some early exposure to HTML and CSS from online forums, but building a full website from scratch felt like a major challenge.

Thankfully, I'm not ashamed to admit that ChatGPT was a huge help throughout this process. I could've used a ready-made boilerplate like [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog by timlrx](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), or something like [Beautiful Jekyll by Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), but I knew that would lead me to the same problem I had before: not knowing how to modify things confidently.

By building the site from scratch - with ChatGPT helping me generate and explain the code - I forced myself to learn. I experimented on my local machine, broke things, fixed them, and through that, I managed to learn basic JavaScript. I'm definitely far from an expert, but now I can at least read and write basic JS. More importantly, I now have a better understanding of how things work, instead of relying purely on templates.
