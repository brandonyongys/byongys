One thing I realized while building this was that programming is only half the job. The other half is design thinking - conceptualizing what you want to build before you write a single line of code. I didn't need every single feature figured out at the start, but I knew I wanted the following:
* Homepage
* About Me page
* Blog page
* Projects page

Since this site serves as part of my personal branding, I also ensured my username, byongys, was consistent across the site. And of course, I added a footer with links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal email to make it easier for people to reach out.

This isn't actually my first attempt at frontend work. Some time ago, I built a basic [hawker centre dashboard](./hawker-centre-dashboard), which I've since decommissioned to save costs. Back then, I barely knew what I was doing - I struggled with APIs, preprocessing, and frontend development - but that experience taught me a lot. I'm glad I went through that phase. It wasn't my best work, but it gave me the confidence to experiment again.

Now, the basic version of the site is live on Netlify (as you can see). It has a homepage, a blog page with my migrated posts, a navigation bar, footer, and a projects page (currently empty).

I chose Netlify because it's simple to use for hosting static sites. Since I'm not running dynamic components or performing CRUD operations yet, it's more than sufficient for now. When I eventually add those features, I'll reassess the best hosting solution.
