    Comparison is the thief of joy.  
    You compare yourself to others and you'll never be happy.  
    What if I'm not satisfied?  
    You could push yourself, but you can't do self-negative talk.

This is an expanded version of a quote I came across years ago. The first line - _Comparison is the thief of joy._ - comes from Theodore Roosevelt, and it has stuck with me ever since. 

Like many, I used to constantly compare myself to others - feeling like I was always falling behind, always less fortunate. But when I came across this expanded version (probably on Instagram or Facebook), something clicked.

Instead of measuring myself against others, I started comparing myself to who I was yesterday. I focused on making small, consistent improvements - just _1%_ better each day. Of course, progress isn't always linear. There are ups and downs, but when I step back and look at the bigger picture, I see how far I've come.

Recently, I caught up with old friends from secondary school, and some of them have achieved incredible success - far beyond where I am now. And for a moment, that comparison got to me. I questioned whether I had worked hard enough or if I had simply been less fortunate.

But then, I reminded myself of the quote. We all started with different backgrounds, different opportunities, and different life missions. It's okay if our paths look different. I choose to be happy for them while also being proud of my own progress.

So, if you ever find yourself caught in the trap of comparison, take a step back. Focus on your own growth. Push yourself forward without tearing yourself down. And most importantly - don't let comparison steal your joy.
