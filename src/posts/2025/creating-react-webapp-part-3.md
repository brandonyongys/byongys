## Is the web app completed?

Not yet. 

Here's what I have planned next:

* Add a CV page for anyone interested in my professional background.
* Add a search feature to help users find blog posts or content.
* Add a filter function on the blog page to filter posts by year.
* Add a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience.

Beyond features, I'll also continue testing on Netlify and fixing any bugs that come up.

Building this React web app has given me a more holistic view of how frontend and backend work together. It's also shown me that frontend development requires more creative thinking than I initially expected. It's not just about making things functional - it's also about thinking through the UI/UX and constantly improving it.

Coming from a backend background, this whole experience has been challenging, but also fun. I may not consider myself a frontend engineer yet, but I know that by continuously learning and building, I'll get better every day. Maybe one day I'll even feel confident enough to call myself full stack.

Lastly, this experience has given me a new appreciation for frontend engineers. Even seemingly small changes - like adding a button - can break an entire layout if you're not careful. Things that look simple on the surface often hide layers of complexity underneath.

For now - I'm just glad I got started.
