It has been a while since my last post, so here is a quick update. I'm still around and doing fine. I haven't dropped off the map or ended up in trouble. Life has just been a lot busier with work and travel.

# Work update

My team is in the middle of a full architecture upgrade while also building features for a new programme that started in September. The go live date is in April 2026, which gives us about seven months to build, test, and get everything ready. On top of that, another team pushes us every month to fix all security issues within fourteen days.

So things have been packed. Doing upgrades while handling both new work and ongoing support is no small task.

# Personal update

I spent two weeks in the UK and it was a good break from the pace back home. I finally had some room to rest and think about where I want to head next in life. I won't go into the details of my career plans yet, but I'm excited about next year's trips.

So far, I've planned a one week trip to China and a two week trip to Europe. I'm still thinking about whether to hike Mount Rinjani in Indonesia and whether to visit a country in the Arctic Circle to see the Northern Lights.
