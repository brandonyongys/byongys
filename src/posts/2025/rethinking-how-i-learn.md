Over the past few weeks, I spent time reflecting on what I have done in 2025. That reflection gave me room to slow down and notice patterns that were easy to miss while staying busy.

One pattern stood out clearly: I have a strong need to keep learning. I am at my best when I am working through something new, difficult, or unfamiliar. That urge was likely what led me to set the goal of writing a weekly post, it was a way to hold myself accountable to learning something new every week.

In hindsight, that goal was also limiting. I defined learning too narrowly and focused almost entirely on technical progress. Learning became something that had to result in a tangible output, often a post, rather than something broader and ongoing. Over time, that framing created unnecessary pressure.

What I have come to realize is that learning does not need to be confined to work or technical skills. It can exist across different parts of life, whether that is physical health, daily habits, or entirely new experiences. Seeing learning this way feels more sustainable and more honest to how I actually grow. It also removes the pressure to publish on a fixed schedule. Going forward, I plan to write more irregularly and only when I have something with real substance to share.

This shift became clearer when I finally decided to apply for the Georgia Tech Master of Science in Computer Science. I do not know what the outcome will be, but taking action on something I had been postponing for a long time brought a sense of relief. Regardless of the result, I will not regret having tried.

That decision came after spending time studying data structures and algorithms through MIT OpenCourseWare 6.006. I went into the course with some hesitation, unsure if the material would be too demanding. It was challenging, but that was also what made it meaningful. The process reminded me that learning something difficult, slowly and deliberately, is still something I value deeply.

Through this period of reflection, I have become more aware of who I am. I am someone who thrives on being challenged and who enjoys learning continuously, not just for professional reasons, but as a way to stay engaged with life. I want to keep gaining new experiences over time, because life is short and letting fear dictate choices feels like a quiet form of stagnation.

That is the perspective I plan to carry into 2026 and beyond.
