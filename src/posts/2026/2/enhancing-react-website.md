My portfolio website has been a work in progress for the longest time. I started off with the [Beautiful Jekyll by Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) before moving to [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) template as my github page. It worked but I felt that it was too generic and lacked personality.

So last June, I decided to build my own website using React, Vite and Tailwind CSS. I wanted to create a website that was unique to me and that I could be proud of. I also wanted to learn more about React and Tailwind CSS. 

The website is enhanced with the following changes before I publicize the repo:
- Centralized the CSS and hardcoded parameters so that changes can made swiftly and propagate throughout the website.
- Fixed aesthetic issues like the shifting of tagline, inconsistent spacing and search bar placement.
- Updated the navigation bar to be more user-friendly.
- Improved the website performance by using code splitting and lazy loading. 
- Added error page to ease troubleshooting during development.

Before I publicized the repo, I also updated the README.md file to make it easier for users to understand how to use the site. I hope the users will find it useful. If you have any questions or ideas, feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email.
