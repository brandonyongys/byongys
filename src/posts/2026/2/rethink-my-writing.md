Recently, I took the the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) proficiency test as part of my overseas plan preparation. Although I am a native English speaker, I have not taken any standardized test for English proficiency before. 

So I prepared for it especially for the writing and speaking sections. The listening and reading sections wouldn't be a challenge though I did do some exercises to familiarize myself with the format. The writing section was tough as I have not written an essay for the longest time. As for speaking section, I was worried about using Singlish slang in my conversation with the examiner.

Nonetheless, the result was as expected. I got Band 8.0 overall, with 9.0 in listening and reading, 7.5 in writing and 7.0 in speaking. I managed to keep my Singlish slang at bay and wrote a reasonably good essay with just 1 month of practice.

As I was preparing for the test, I realized that LLM has really made all language tasks easier. In fact, most of my preparation was done with the help of LLM and that has saved me a lot of time. I could write an essay anytime and get it reviewed by LLM instantly. The feedback was prompt and I could improve it right away.

However, I must say that I have taken my English skills for granted as I have been using it to work on most of my writing tasks. If you haven't noticed, most of my posts here are written with the help of LLM. It was prompted to write in a certain style so that the content is something I would write.

No doubt that LLM has made my life easier. I could understand and write technical documents with ease and not necessarily with proper grammar, but I think it's important especially for me as a software engineer to maintain and improve my ability to communicate in plain language with minimal help from LLM.

For once, I would start writing my posts with little help from LLM by implementing what I've learned from my IELTS preparation - drafting out the content and structure first before writing the actual post.
